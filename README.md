## CIT 281 Project 07

In this project, we are:
- Creating either an organization-level or user-level GitHub Page, and adding content to this Page. This Page will be the entry web page for your portfolio
- Creating repos for each of the labs and projects for the CIT 281 class
- Creating a GitHub Page for each of the labs and projects that provides a brief description of the lab or project, and a screen capture
- Adding links to the organization or user Page to each of the labs and projects


Throughout the project, I learned how to create repos and turn them into pages of an actual webpage. By going through each lab and project, I also got the chance to look over a lot of the work I did in this class.
