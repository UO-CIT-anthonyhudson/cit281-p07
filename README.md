## CIT 281 Project 01

In this project, we had to:
- Use the command line interface (CLI) of your operating system to create a number of folders
- List the folders in a tree-like structure
- Use the ping command, and practice using the break keyboard sequence
- Create and execute a JavaScript files using Node.js and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) terminal and Run and Debug

Throughout the project, I refined my skills with the CLI commands, as well as got practice with VSCode and executing non-web server Node.js JS code.
